# Share of open access journal articles
We want to analyse an institution's publication output and determine the share of open access articles. To do so we retrieve data from different bibliographic databases and match it with data from the Directory of Open Access Journals (DOAJ) to identify OA articles in OA jouranls.
The python script described here analyses the retrieved data and produces both total numbers and a list of articles as downloadable files. To identify OA articles in hybrid journals the CrossRef API is called. 
Results on OA articles in OA journals and in hybrid journals are treated separatedly.

## Project description
The python scripts analyses article data and identifies those articles that were published in a) gold open access journals and b) hybrid journals. 
The script DOES aggregate, normalise and duplicate check for article data. The script outputs different files (tab-separated txt) for further analysis.
The script DOES NOT retrieve article data from databases -- this has to be done beforehand! Instructions for retrieval of article data are included in the (German) manual.

## How to
See further information on input/output files and the most important script variables [here](/file-var-info.md).

A full manual in German is available as [PDF file](/manual.pdf) and [LaTeX project](/manual-tex). See the manual for information on
* how to retrieve article data from different databases (e.g. Web of Science, SciFinder, PubMed),
* how to prepare article data for the python script,
* output files,
* how to add or delete databases from the analysis.

## Contribution history
The python script was developed mainly by [Eva Bunge](https://github.com/ebunge) with support from [Michaela Voigt](https://github.com/michaelavoigt). The script is maintained by the Open Access team of TU Berlin University Library.
